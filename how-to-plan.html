Enter the tax deduction rate as a percentage and specify the date until which this deduction is valid. This helps you model tax benefits like the Dutch "hypotheekrenteaftrek" or similar tax advantages in other countries.</p>
                    <p data-i18n="howToPlan.step3Mortgage.taxDeduction.note">💡 <strong>Note:</strong> Many countries offer tax deductions on mortgage interest to encourage homeownership. Check your local tax regulations to determine if you qualify and what percentage applies to you.</p>

By modeling different scenarios, you can understand how your mortgage affects your ability to save and retire early.</p>

            <p data-i18n="howToPlan.step6.example.description">We add a savings account with a 6% annual interest rate. The deposits will stop at the early retirement date, and the savings account will end at the fixed retirement date—the remaining balance goes to the main account.</p>

            <p data-i18n="howToPlan.step6.example.details">Note that we set both deposits and withdrawals to be inflation-adjusted. This ensures our savings strategy keeps pace with rising costs.</p>
            
            <p data-i18n="howToPlan.step6.example.withdrawal">We set up a withdrawal of 2,000 per month during the period between early retirement and the fixed pension date. This covers the income gap when our job income stops but pension hasn't started yet. The interest continues to grow on the remaining balance during the withdrawal period.</p>

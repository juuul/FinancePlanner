    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Finance Planner was created by Juliaan Meijboom and Colin Wilmans, two passionate advocates for financial independence and smart financial planning. As members of the F.I.R.E. (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement, they understood firsthand the challenges of planning for long-term financial goals.</p>
    <p>Frustrated by expensive financial advisors and complex planning tools that were either too costly or too simplistic, they decided to create a comprehensive, free solution that anyone could use. The result is Finance Planner—a powerful tool that combines professional-grade financial modeling with an intuitive, user-friendly interface.</p>
    <p>Today, Finance Planner helps thousands of people worldwide plan their path to financial independence, model different scenarios, and make informed decisions about their financial future.</p>

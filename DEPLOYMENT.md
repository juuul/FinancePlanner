# Deployment History

This file tracks deployment events for the Finance Planner website.

## How to Redeploy

The website automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the `main` branch. The deployment workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml`.

To trigger a redeployment:
1. Update the "Last Deployment" timestamp below
2. Commit and push to `main` branch (or merge a PR that includes this change)

Alternatively, the workflow can be manually triggered using GitHub Actions' workflow_dispatch feature from the Actions tab.
